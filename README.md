#Batman
This is nowhere near finished, so don't even bother trying to download it yet.

##Progress
Don't judge me... I just started work earlier this evening...

To Do | Status
:---|:---
Recognize Bat armor | Done! All black leather armor + skull of redrocketjj (specific to my server) - will add config for this later.
Keep track of each player's "Batman status" | Done!
Add "Batman buffs" | Done!
Snowballs deal damage | Done!
Fishing rods become grappling hooks | Functional. Does a weird thing with the fishing rod, like when ClearLag takes the hook - you have to click to reset and then click again to use it again. Looking into fixing this. It does work though, as is.
Bats spawn as your allies | Not started
Punches do extra damage and have a chance to stun | Partially done. Stun is super slowness, so players can still look around and interact. Possibly will change this later.
Swords are weaker | Not started
Armor is unbreakable | Done! Armor glows with the enchantment, so will look into removing this for aesthetic purposes.
