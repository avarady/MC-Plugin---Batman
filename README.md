#Superhero Plugin
###(Started as Batman only, hence the name)
This plugin was made for my own server, so I haven't added any config or permissions, as it works as I would like without them. However, I will add them in the future.

######Special thanks to redrocketjj for the idea and the buff / ability specifics! (Actually, all I did was write the code for this - he came up with everything.)

##To-Do

Item | Notes
:---|:---
Fishing rods become grappling hooks | Functional, using teleport. Want to animate it in the future.
Punches do extra damage and have a chance to stun (Batman) | Partially done. Stun is super slowness, so players can still look around and interact. Possibly will change this later.
Ability to climb walls | Postponed - this will take a while.
